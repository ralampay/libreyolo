"""Declarative augmentation-knob spec: which family honors which knob.

This module is the single source of truth for how each trainable model family
treats the augmentation knobs on :class:`~libreyolo.training.config.TrainConfig`.
It is a plain-Python table (no torch/cv2 imports) derived by reading each
family's trainer + transform + dataset-wrapper code, and it is pinned to
reality by ``tests/unit/test_augment_spec.py``, which asserts the claimed
statuses against the actual pipeline plumbing.

Consumers:
  - ``libreyolo.cli.config.get_unsupported_train_params`` warns when a user
    explicitly sets a CLI training parameter that the selected family ignores
    (previously this existed only for RF-DETR).
  - ``BaseTrainer._setup_data`` (and FOMO's data setup) warn when
    ``mixup_prob > 0`` can never fire because the family only applies mixup to
    mosaic samples and ``mosaic_prob == 0``.
  - Docs generation can render the support matrix instead of hand-writing it.

Statuses:
  - ``USED``: the knob reaches the family's train pipeline and changes samples.
  - ``GATED_BY_MOSAIC``: the knob is only applied to samples that took the
    mosaic branch (probability ``mosaic_prob``); with ``mosaic_prob == 0`` it
    never fires. This is how the YOLOX-style wrappers apply affine and mixup.
  - ``IGNORED``: the knob never reaches the family's train pipeline; setting
    it silently does nothing.

Keys are TrainConfig field names (``mosaic_prob``, not the CLI alias
``mosaic``); the CLI consumer maps to CLI spellings via
``libreyolo.cli.aliases.TRAIN_ALIASES``.
